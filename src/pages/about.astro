                At the core of his doctoral research is a critical analysis of how counterterrorism measures intersect with democratic processes and governance across Africa. This groundbreaking work meticulously dissects the utilization of Counterterrorism Measures (CTMs) by political actors in Nigeria and Kenya to sway electoral outcomes. By weaving together historical, economic, and socio-political threads, Chima aims to unravel the complexities that underpin the use of CTMs in elections. My research seeks to illuminate the nuanced similarities, differences, and patterns in how state actors employ these measures, assessing their broader socio-political ramifications and contribution to the global trend of democratic recession. I am supervised by Professor Gabrielle Lynch and Dr. Trevor McCrisken, both esteemed members of the Politics and International Studies department at Warwick.
