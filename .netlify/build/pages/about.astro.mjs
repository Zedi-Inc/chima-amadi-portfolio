At the core of his doctoral research is a critical analysis of how
						counterterrorism measures intersect with democratic processes and
						governance across Africa. This groundbreaking work meticulously
						dissects the utilization of Counterterrorism Measures (CTMs) by
						political actors in Nigeria and Kenya to sway electoral outcomes. By
						weaving together historical, economic, and socio-political threads,
						Chima aims to unravel the complexities that underpin the use of CTMs
						in elections. My research seeks to illuminate the nuanced
						similarities, differences, and patterns in how state actors employ
						these measures, assessing their broader socio-political
						ramifications and contribution to the global trend of democratic
						recession. I am supervised by Professor Gabrielle Lynch and Dr.
						Trevor McCrisken, both esteemed members of the Politics and
						International Studies department at Warwick.
